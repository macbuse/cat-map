# cat-map

This is a JuPyteR notebook/numpy implementation of the [cat map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold%27s_cat_map).

There is also a notebook for applying a [Dehn twist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehn_twist) to an image.


They are examples of basic image manipulation using operations on numpy arrays obtained from images loaded via 
[scikit](http://scikit-image.org/). I don't intend to document these any further.
